      <p class="subTitle">About</p>
      <p class="blockText">Hello! My name is Michael Tang. I am a senior at the University of Colorado - Boulder studying computer science and mathematics.
My interest in computer science involve writting programs in C, C++, and Python, studying weird data structures, and learning how to write better algorithms.
In my free time, I enjoy making small projects ranging from iOS apps, themes/packages for jailbroken iPhones, to even working on my own programming language! plus this <i>silly</i> attempt at making my own website, recalling my all
strengths in CSS. Scroll below to see my past projects, profession, and contact information!

      <p class="blockText">One of my favorite things to do is craft new icons for iPhones. I went back to the old iOS icons ideas and crafted each icon you see below from scratch. This year-long project yielded 50+ icons and over 3K downloads on the Cydia Store.
      The complete list of icons are <a href="Images/college.png">here</a> and my previous work of <a href="Images/highSchool.jpg">icons</a> before flatness took over.

      <p class="subTitle">MacOS GUI for iPhone</p>
      <p class="blockText">Jailbreaking iPhone gives users more than just the ability to
change the apperances of icons; it can also change the entire experience. My most recent theme redesigned the home screen
of iPhones to be of a Mac! This particular theme has accumulated 200K+ downloads. See a review <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UzA_JnWp4eI">here</a>.

    <img src="Images/AcornHero.png" id="cocoaHero" alt="Acorn banner" title="Acorn banner"/>
    <p class="blockText">
    One of my more ambitious project, Acorn, is a programming language made from scratch. It's the most challenging project I've taken on so far. Building a program that takes a program with infinite combinations of legal input became a mind-boggling realization.
    This project took a month to complete and near a year to refine. Acorn is an interpreted-programming language written in Python, which means
    that Acorn code becomes translated into and evaulated in Python. The goal of this project was to learn more about language creation, lexing, recursive-descent parsing, interpreting, language syntax/semantics,
    parse tress, abstract syntax trees, abstract-memory handling, lexical scoping, etc...

    <p class="subTitle">Iris - Assistive Technology</p>
    <p class="blockText">Iris is an iOS app that assist those with visual impairments. Iris uses <a href="https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract">Tesseract - OCR</a> to analyze image-text and converts it to digital text. A feature of Iris
    translates further this image-text by turning it into viberational braille. See a demonstration video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btsu3TAQu9Q&feature=youtu.be">here</a>.</p>

    <p class="blockText">Present: I am working currently with others tracking all collections within the Norlin Archives in preparation to move their local database to an online database solution. My responsibilities include cross-referencing collections within the Norlin Archive stacks against their local database and finding anomalies.
<br/><br/>
2015-2016: I handled a subset of photograph order from patrons wishing to having historic/university photographs digitized for non-profit/profit use. My responsibilities included corresponding with the patrons, handling payments, and digitization of photographs.
<br/><br/>
2014-2015: Developed Python scripts to automate the process of floppy disk analysis. A large set of floppy disks were digitized, and each disk produced an extensive log on its state-of-condition. These Python script batch-examined the logs and yielded a report concerning possible corruption on track/sectors of disks.</p>

<p class="blockText">
I held office hours for the students of the Intro to Programming summer 2017 class at CU Boulder. My responsibilities include holding hours of assistance for individuals with computer science questions regarding the course and assignments. The intro programming class centralizes around C++, learning variables, control structures, loops, classes, and basic I/O.
