      <p class="subTitle">About</p>
      <p class="blockText">Hello! My name is Michael Tang. I am a senior at the University of Colorado - Boulder studying computer science and mathematics.
My interest in computer science involve writting programs in C, C++, and Python, studying weird data structures, and learning how to write better algorithms that are not <i>O(n!)</i>.
In my free time, I enjoy making small projects ranging from iOS apps, themes/packages for jailbroken iPhones, to even working on my own programming language! plus this <i>silly</i> attempt at making my own website, recalling my all
strengths in CSS. Scroll below to see my past project!

      <p class="subTitle">Projects</p>
      <p class="blockText">iOS themes/packages. <i>For best parallax effect, view this site on a mobile device!</i>. One of my favorite things to do is craft new icons for iPhones. Back in the <i>old</i> days, iOS looked so pretty until it became a flat-mix of bright colors that looks like a
      child's toy phone that is today... With my Adobe Photoshop, I went back to the old iOS icons and crafted each icon you see below from scratch. This year long project yield 50+ icons and over 3K downloads on the Cydia Store. </p>
